**Welcome to Constructor Hangman!**

* Be sure to install package.json INCLUDING INQUIRER before you begin.

* This is a command-line application in which you will be prompted to guess the letters of an unknown word. 

* You will have fifteen tries to guess the entire word.

* To play, navigate to the appropriate folder in your terminal and run the command "node index.js".

* If you guess correctly or run out of turns, you will be asked if you would like to play again.

* Good luck!
